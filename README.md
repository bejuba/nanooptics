# nanooptics
Python module for data evaluation and presentation developed in the nanooptics group at the Humboldt University Berlin.

## installation
The correlator makes heavy use of cython. Therefore those modules have to be compiled.
The setup.py should take care of this when installing the module with pip

Therefore simply cloning and installing should just work


```
git clone https://github.com/berndso/nanooptics.git

python setup.py install
```
